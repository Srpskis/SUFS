Architecture of SUFS 

SUFS system will consist of three individual subsystems, communicating via HTTP calls with Flask servers.
The client will be how the user interacts with the system. The NameNode will maintain a list of the 
contents of each DataNode and route read requests appropriately. The DataNodes will store blocks of
files and periodically communicate to the NameNode their stored contents. 

When writing a file to the system, the client will contact the NameNode to request the space for the file.
The NameNode will reply with a list of DataNodes for the client to write to. The client will then break up
the file according to the block size and send each block to each DataNode. The DataNodes will then store 
those blocks.
